# Student Pass/Fail Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes data mining techniques to **predict whether a student will pass or fail** their exams. The prediction is based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, sleep quality, and facility ratings. The analysis is performed using **KNIME Analytics Platform**.

## 🧠 Models Used
We implemented and compared two classification algorithms:
1.  **Decision Tree**
2.  **Random Forest**

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **data/**: Contains the raw input dataset (raw_student_data.xlsx).
* **workflow/**: The KNIME workflow file (exam_prediction_workflow.knwf).
* **results/**: Output predictions (Pass/Fail), confusion matrices, and accuracy metrics.
* **visualizations/**: Charts analyzing demographics, attendance impact, and pass rates.
* **docs/**: Full project report in PDF format.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Visualizations** can be found in the visualizations folder.
* **Model Accuracy & Confusion Matrices** are available in the results folder.
