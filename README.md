# Student Score Predictor

## ?? Project Overview
This project utilizes data mining techniques to predict student exam scores based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, sleep quality, and facility ratings. The analysis is performed using **KNIME Analytics Platform**.

## ?? Models Used
We implemented and compared two machine learning algorithms:
1.  **Decision Tree**
2.  **Random Forest**

## ?? Repository Structure
* **data/**: Contains the raw input dataset (aw_student_data.xlsx).
* **workflow/**: The KNIME workflow file (exam_prediction_workflow.knwf).
* **esults/**: Output predictions, confusion matrices, and accuracy metrics for both models.
* **isualizations/**: Charts analyzing demographics, attendance impact, and grade distribution.
* **docs/**: Full project report in PDF format.

## ?? Key Findings
* **Visualizations** can be found in the isualizations folder.
* **Model Accuracy** comparisons are available in the esults folder.
